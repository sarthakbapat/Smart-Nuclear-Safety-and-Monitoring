# Smart-Nuclear-Safety-and-Monitoring
This repository contains the Smart cities and IoT project implemented as a part of our curriculum. We have developed a smart safety system for nuclear office building where the system monitors the radiation value and takes necessary actions to ensure the safety. 

To run the project follow the following steps:
1. Run the file MAIN_SCRIPT.py on the Raspberry Pi. Keep its dependencies in the same folder.
2. Run the file server.py on the laptop. Keep the dependencies in the folder structure required for the Flask application.
3. Then visit localhost:5000 on the browser in laptop. The server's page will load on that path.
4. The data could be then seen on the UI page.
